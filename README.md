# PDF-Chatbot
Chatbot that ingests PDFs to create a tailored LLM solution

The goal of this project was to follow the following tutorial, but start my code from scratch instead of forking and running the author's code. This allows for a better learning oppurtunity. Much debugging was run to get the code to work in alignment with the tutorial (see YouTube link below).

Finished product (tailored to my use case)
