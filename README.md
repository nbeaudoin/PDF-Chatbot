# PDF-Chatbot
Chatbot that ingests PDFs to create a tailored LLM solution

The goal of this project was to follow the following tutorial, but start my code from scratch as a learning opportunity, instead of forking and running the author's code. The author's code has also been forked and stared to give them credit!  Much debugging was run to get the code to work in alignment with the tutorial and some changes were made to accomodate that (see YouTube link below).

Finished product (tailored to my use case)
